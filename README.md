## Features

- Create bank accounts

- Database Schema: See `dbdesign.pdf` for entity relationships and table definitions.  
- Typical flow: User initiates operation â†’ validation â†’ DB transaction â†’ update account(s) â†’ confirmation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK (version 11 or above recommended)  
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2)  
- (Optional) An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse  

### Installation

1. Clone this repository  
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tott1o/bankApp.git
 cd bankApp
````

2. Configure your database settings in the application configuration (e.g., connection URL, user, password).
3. Build the project (if using Maven/Gradle) or compile via your IDE.

### Running the Application

* Run the `main()` method in the appropriate class (e.g., `Application.java`) via your IDE or from command-line.
* Follow console prompts (or UI if added) to perform banking operations.
* Verify that transactions are persisted to the configured database.

## Database Design

See the included `dbdesign.pdf` file for a comprehensive schema diagram.
Major entities:

* **Account**: stores account details (account number, owner name, balance, etc.)
* **Transaction**: logs deposits, withdrawals, and transfers with timestamps
* **Customer** (optional/extendable): if you model customers separately in future

## Usage

Here are typical interactions:

1. Create a new account with initial deposit.
2. Deposit funds into an existing account.
3. Withdraw funds, with checks for sufficient balance.
4. Transfer money between two accounts (source â†’ destination).
5. Query account details / transaction history (if implemented).

**Example**:

```
Welcome to bankApp!
Please select an option:
1) Create Account
2) Deposit
3) Withdraw
4) Transfer
5) Exit
```
